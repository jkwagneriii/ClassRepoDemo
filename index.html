            My name is Jerry Kenneth Wagner III...BUT I go by Jake. I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas so it's quite nice to be in Chicago away from the heat. 
            I have a BFA in Acting and have gotten to be in a couple movies since college (as pictured above.) I also have a professional background in fine dining and drink creation. 
            Before the covid lockdown, I was in charge of creating all the nationwide seasonal beverages for Intelligentsia Coffee.
            My other passions include fermentation, making movies, and making meditation music in Logic.
